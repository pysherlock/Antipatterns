    <title>Why Cocoon 3 - Motivation</title>
    <para>
      The main idea behind Cocoon is the concept of pipelines. Cocoon 1.x and 2.x
      applied this idea with a focus on web applications.
      But sometimes pipelines would be useful although you don't develop a web application.
      Those former Cocoon versions don't really help you in that case. 
    </para>
    <para>
      In contrast, Cocoon 3 follows a layered approach so that its basic module - 
      the pipeline module - can be used from within any Java environment without 
      requiring you adding a huge stack of dependencies. 
    </para>
    <para>
      On top of this, Cocoon 3 has the goal to make the development of 
      RESTful web services and web applications a simple task.
